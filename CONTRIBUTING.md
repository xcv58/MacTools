# Contributing to MacTools

<a href="CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md">[中文]</a> [English]

Thanks for your interest in MacTools. Please keep each contribution small and clear: explain the problem, provide verifiable changes, and avoid mixing unrelated refactors into the same pull request.

## Ways to Contribute
- Bug reports should include reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, macOS version, and relevant logs or screenshots.
- Feature suggestions should describe the use case, target users, and expected interaction. For large plugins or interaction changes, open an issue first to align on scope.
- Changes involving file deletion, system permissions, global shortcuts, display control, signing, or update flows should explain risks, safeguards, and rollback options.

## Development Environment
- Xcode and `xcodegen` are required. The project supports macOS 14.0 and later.
- First-time setup: run `make setup`, then edit `LocalConfig.xcconfig` and fill in `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and `BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX`.
- Common commands: `make generate` generates the Xcode project, `make build` validates compilation, and `make run` runs the app locally.
- Plugin development: `make run` incrementally builds the app and plugins, then syncs the latest Debug plugin packages to the local development marketplace. `make sync-debug-plugins` only syncs already built plugins. `make build-plugin` is reserved for validating dynamic plugin packages or release flows; to build one plugin, run `make build-plugin PLUGIN=calendar`.
- Do not commit local or generated files: `MacTools.xcodeproj`, `MacTools.xcworkspace`, `LocalConfig.xcconfig`, `build/`, or `scripts/release.local.env`.

## Project Structure
- `Sources/App/`: app entry point, menu bar status item, settings pages, and window routing.
- `Sources/Core/`: shared infrastructure such as the plugin host, dynamic plugin loading, shortcuts, permissions, logging, and updates.
- `Sources/MacToolsPluginKit/`: plugin APIs, declarative UI models, and runtime context.
- `Plugins/<PluginName>/`: plugin manifest, source code, bundle entry point, resources, and adjacent tests.
- `Tests/`: XCTest coverage for shared App/Core logic. Plugin tests should live inside the corresponding plugin directory when possible.
- `project.yml`: root XcodeGen project source, only for the App, PluginKit, and shared aggregate entry points. Plugin targets are generated automatically.
- `Plugins/<PluginName>/project.yml`: optional per-plugin build overrides, only when a plugin needs extra frameworks, include paths, bundle resources, helper/tool targets, or target overrides.
- `docs/plugins/`: plugin packages, catalogs, local debugging, and release flow documentation.
- `docs/icon-gallery/`: checked-in menu-bar icon catalog, previews, animation frames, and archives; rendering-mode rules are documented in `docs/icon-gallery.md`.
- `docs/superpowers/`: larger product, interaction, or implementation design documents.

## Development Guidelines
- Add new plugins under `Plugins/<PluginName>/` with at least `plugin.json`, `Sources/`, and `Bundle/`.
- Ordinary plugins only need to define `plugin.json`, source code, and a bundle entry point. `make generate` scans `Plugins/*/plugin.json` and generates local `Configs/GeneratedPlugins.yml`; do not edit generated files manually.
- Features that require macOS app extensions, such as Finder Sync, must add the extension target to the root `project.yml` and embed it in the main app. Use the dynamic plugin only for the MacTools panel/settings surface.
- Command workflows for adding and updating plugins are documented in the Development Steps section of `docs/plugins/local-native-plugins.md`.
- Keep documentation short and task-focused. User-visible behavior changes should update `README.md` or the relevant file under `docs/`; plugin package, catalog, or release flow changes should update `docs/plugins/`.
- Icon gallery assets must explicitly declare `renderingMode`; use `template` only for black artwork on transparency, and use `original` for color or grayscale detail. Third-party static assets must pin their upstream revision and catalog mapping in `docs/icon-gallery/sources/manifest.json`, with the corresponding license under `Sources/Resources/ThirdPartyNotices/`. Run the gallery generation and related tests after catalog changes.
- Plugins implement `MacToolsPlugin`; menu panel plugins implement `PluginPrimaryPanel`, and component panel plugins implement `PluginComponentPanel`.
- `plugin.json.id` must be stable, readable, and exactly match the runtime `PluginMetadata.id`; each plugin package should return exactly one plugin instance.
- Plugin display state should be expressed through `PluginPanelState`, `PluginPanelDetail`, `PluginPanelControl`, and related models. Do not bypass the existing panel framework.
- Prefer declarative plugin settings through `settingsSections`, `permissionRequirements`, `shortcutDefinitions`, and related models. Use a custom `PluginConfiguration` view for interactive preferences, complex managers, or specialized interactions the declarative models cannot express.
- If ordinary plugin resources rarely change, prefer bundling them into the executable. If extra bundle resources are needed, declare the smallest necessary differences in the plugin's own `project.yml`.
- Custom plugin settings views must reuse `MacToolsPluginKit.PluginSettingsTheme` and `.pluginSettingsCardBackground(...)`. Do not copy private plugin settings styles, and do not make plugins depend on `Sources/App/SettingsStyle.swift`.
- Call `onStateChange?()` after plugin state changes. Long-running scans, file system work, and system calls should not block the main thread for extended periods.
- User-facing copy is primarily Chinese. Keep it concise, clear, and close to native macOS wording.
- Localize user-facing copy with `.xcstrings`. App/Core copy belongs under `Sources/Resources/Localization`, PluginKit copy under `Sources/MacToolsPluginKit/Resources`, and plugin copy under `Plugins/<PluginName>/Resources`. Plugin `plugin.json` files should keep `displayName`/`summary` as fallbacks and add `localizedMetadata` for marketplace and unloaded-plugin presentation.
- New plugins should provide localization whenever practical, at minimum for panel copy, settings copy, permission text, and plugin metadata.
- Prefer Apple native frameworks. When adding system frameworks, private include paths, or helper executables inside a plugin bundle, declare the smallest necessary differences in the plugin's own `project.yml`. Bundle resource executables that need separate signing should be listed in `plugin.json.package.signPaths`.
- Plugins that use private Apple frameworks must load them dynamically at runtime and validate the required classes and selectors. Do not statically link private frameworks, and surface unsupported-system errors instead of crashing.

## Testing
- Behavioral changes should add or update adjacent XCTest coverage. Test files should be named `<TypeName>Tests.swift`.
- Full test command: `xcodebuild -project MacTools.xcodeproj -scheme MacTools -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData test -quiet`.
- Single test class: append `-only-testing:MacToolsTests/<TestClassName>` to the full test command.
- File system tests should use temporary directories or fake stores. Disk cleanup tests must not delete real user directories.
- A manual GitHub Actions `Build` run uploads a 14-day `MacTools-Debug` development snapshot containing `MacTools Dev.app` and plugins built from the same commit. Maintainers may schedule that snapshot daily at `06:00 UTC` with the repository variable `ENABLE_SCHEDULED_DEV_SNAPSHOTS=true`; see `docs/github-actions.md` for activation, download, and pause instructions. This Debug artifact is not the public, auto-updating MacTools Nightly channel: it is not Developer ID signed or notarized, does not create a GitHub Release or Sparkle appcast, and cannot update in-app. The final Nightly channel is tracked in [issue #243](https://github.com/ggbond268/MacTools/issues/243) and must use its separate `ENABLE_NIGHTLY_RELEASES` publication gate.

## Pull Request Checklist
- Keep the PR focused, and explain the purpose, verification, and user impact.
- Prefer English for commit messages, pull request titles/descriptions, and issues.
- Build or tests have passed. If they could not be run, explain why in the PR.
- User-visible behavior changes are reflected in `README.md` or the relevant design documentation.
- User-visible app or plugin changes include a concise English changelog fragment in `changes/unreleased/*.md`.
- High-risk features cover safety checks, error states, and missing-permission cases.
- The PR does not include unrelated formatting, generated files, local configuration, certificates, or release credentials.

## Release
- Releases are handled by maintainers. Do not create tags, publish GitHub Releases, or commit release artifacts in ordinary contributions.
- For GitHub-based releases, prefer `Actions` -> `Prepare Release`. Enter `type`, target `version`, and whether to `release`; when `release` is enabled, the workflow continues to the actual release workflow after bumping, committing, and creating the tag.
- For quick releases, prefer `make release`. The command interactively chooses `app` or `plugin`, analyzes the next `patch`/`minor`/`major` version, previews the bump, then only after confirmation runs `git pull --rebase`, lightweight checks, version updates, commit, tag creation, and tag push.
- App releases update `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `Configs/AppVersion.xcconfig`. The app and embedded extensions inherit this shared version config. After pushing a `v*.*.*` tag, the `Release` workflow builds, signs, notarizes, uploads the DMG, marks the stable App release as GitHub Latest, and updates the Appcast plus website download metadata.
- Plugin releases push a `plugins-*` batch tag. The default `auto` mode uses the production catalog to find new plugins, already bumped plugins, and package-related plugin changes; it updates `plugin.json.version` when needed, then the `Plugin Release` workflow builds plugins and merges the signed catalog. Plugin batch releases are never marked as GitHub Latest.
- On first launch, a new app version checks installed plugins and automatically updates them from the signed production catalog. It does not automatically install plugins the user has not installed.
- Non-interactive examples: `make release ARGS="--type app --version 1.0.7 --yes"` or `make release ARGS="--type plugin --version 1.0.10 --plugin-mode selected --plugin calendar --yes"`.
- Add `--dry-run` to preview the steps. The working tree must be clean before a real release.
- Before local release builds, copy `scripts/release.local.env.sample` to `scripts/release.local.env` and fill in at least `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION`.
- If Apple notarization is needed, store credentials first with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`.
- Version numbers default to `MARKETING_VERSION` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in `Configs/AppVersion.xcconfig`.
- Local production builds can still use the lower-level script: `./scripts/release-local.sh`; before publishing to GitHub Releases, run `gh auth login`, then `./scripts/release-local.sh --publish`.
- Plugin library releases are triggered by `plugins-*` batch tags through the `Plugin Release` workflow. Within one PluginKit ABI line, plugins with bumped versions are built and uploaded, then merged into that line's catalog. Changes under `Sources/MacToolsPluginKit/` require rebuilding and bumping every plugin so the catalog cannot retain binaries linked against an older shared framework. The first release of a new ABI also rebuilds every plugin and writes a versioned catalog such as `docs/plugins/v3/catalog.json`; the legacy v2 catalog remains untouched. The catalog private key, Developer ID certificate, and GitHub token must come from CI secrets or local environment variables.
- GitHub Actions build and release configuration is documented in `docs/github-actions.md`; plugin catalog, package structure, and batch release flows are documented in `docs/plugins/plugin-catalog.md`.
